Build a regression model to predict the Take-Off Weight (TOW) of Ryanair flights based on flight data from October 2016. I started with data exploration to understand feature distributions and correlations, followed by data cleaning; handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. The most important features turned out to be the number of passengers, total fuel used, and baggage weight. I tested several regression models i.a. Linear Regression, Random Forest. I had alligned the data with more realistic approach by adding fuel weight and crew. Random Forst gave the best results in terms of RMSE, so I used it for the final predictions. All the details are in the notebook. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this project :).
